//  Loops are also called  Iterators 
// Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
// Often this is the case when working with arrays:

// loop has 3 stages :    initialization   ->     Conditions  ->      Execution


// FOR 

for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++ ){
    console.log('Hello World')
}


//  example 2 for loop
for (let x = 1; x < 5; x++){
    console.log(x)
}
